    // note that 4 decimal places seems to reduce round off error when calculating the mesh resolution
    // 
    // the domain is expecting an H x 4H x H vegetation fence to be placed 10H downwind in x and right in the middle of the domain in y 
    // with 10H of empty space on each side, a 50 ft x 50 ft x 30 ft (15.2400 m x 15.2400 m x 9.1440 m) house/building to be placed 
    // at a max of 20H downwind of the vegetation fence and right in the middle of the domain in y, with 15H of empty space downwind of the 
    // building and 7Hbdg - H (in this case 7H because that is bigger) of empty space above the vegetation fence. H is the height of the vegetation 
    // fence and Hbdg is the height of the building, where the fence is made up of 4 single trees each of size L x W x H, the mesh resolution chosen 
    // to give 6 cells per side of a single tree. so dx = L/6, dy = W/6, dz = H/6. But in these sets of cases, the trees are considered to be the same 
    // size in x, y, and z, so L == W == H and dx == dy == dz = H/6.
    // 
    // In this case, H = 72 ft (21.9456 m), so the vegetation fence is of size 72 ft x 288 ft x 72 ft (21.9456 m x 87.7824 m x 21.9456 m),
    // and dx = dy = dz = H/6 = 72 ft / 6 = 12 ft (3.6576 m).
    // 
    // note that the building is placed using a size of 50 ft x 50 ft x 30 ft, but it is considered to be of size 60 ft x 60 ft x 30 ft for evening meshing at
    // the 12 ft resolution
    // 
    // technically the house/building and vegetation fence aren't always placed in the domain, the idea is that the domain is sized as if they 
    // are both placed in the domain even for the cases where they are purposefully not placed into the domain. Heck, for some of the base cases,
    // buildings are placed in all kinds of different locations, the idea is to have the domain big enough for the farthest downwind building case
    // which is the 20H building case even if buildings are placed with less distance than that to the fence.
    // 
    // 
    // The domain size in x is 10H to the vegetation fence, H for the vegetation fence, a max of 20H between the vegetation fence and the house/building,
    //  60 ft (5/6H) for the house/building, 15H downwind of the building to the domain end for the max of 20H between the fence and the house/building,
    //  for a total of 10H + 1H + 20H + 5/6H + 15H = 46 5/6H = 3312 ft + 60 ft = 3372 ft (1027.7856 m)
    // The domain size in y is 10H to the vegetation fence, 288 ft (4H) for the vegetation fence, and 10H from the vegetation fence to the domain end,
    //  for a total of 10H + 288 ft (4H) + 10H = 24H = 1728 ft (526.6944 m)
    // The domain size in z used to be 1H for the vegetation fence and 7H above the fence to the top of the domain, BUT adding in the building made that 
    //  domain too short. But in this case, 8H is bigger than 7Hbdg, so that is what is used. So 8H = 8*72ft = 576 ft (175.5648 m)
